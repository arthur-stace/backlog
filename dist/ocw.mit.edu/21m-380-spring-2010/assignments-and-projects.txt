This contrasts with the more common activity of parsing a string of already-generated terminals into higher-level nonterminals,which is essentially the reverse process. A sequence of terminals can then be processed to produce some sort of output, such as a sound or a song. Using this system, complex definitions can be easily created as a series of productions, each of which maps a symbol to one or more probabilistically-weighted expansions, in order to create complex randomized, but structured, behavior."

Soon enough, they became a widely known method to solve optimization problems in computer science and several genetic algorithmic systems were developed, such as Evolver. Genetic algorithms are not only suited for computer science; they may also be applied to artistic domains. For example, Ariza discusses an alternative application of GA\u0026#39;s. Rather than moving towards a complex solution, Ariza\u0026#39;s genetic algorithm system pulls from a trajectory of rhythmic populations that moves towards a simple solution. My work with Genetic Algorithms also focuses on creating interesting trends from an evolutionary process that moves towards a simple solution. I show that my system can be applied to granular synthesis to make compelling gestures..."

The krar, a 5-string harp-like instrument is strummed in quick motions with tight clumps of fast ornament and longer notes, typically in some 12/8 rhythm or freely. Ethiopian music is built on pentatonic scales and contains a few that Western music does not; I picked one to use called , one of the most distinctive scales. Its tones are 1, 2, 4, 4, 6. Many Ethiopian melodies work in a scalar fashion, moving up or down the scale and only infrequently skipping tones. I thought that these two aspects of some Ethiopian music—the rhythmic density and melody scalar-ity—could be imitated and extended with markov chains."

I programmed an octave and a half of notes and set the melodic chain to favor notes closer together and to only rarely jump larger distances. The rhythmic chain is configured to favor fast passages but if a slower passage is played it allows for space before returning to faster movement. Various functions controlled the order of these chains. I also varied octave, bpm,and amplitude settings with a set of parameter objects such as the 1/f noise generator, basketgens, beta distributions, and break point lines."

I generated even further diversity by speeding up or slowing down some of the passages in a particular synth instrument that resembled some type of acidic gurgle. The second section features a beat made in Live and repeating clips from the markov passages that I found to be quite creative. I was surprised how quickly the markov generation resulted in a line that was desirable."

AthenaCL can generate interesting beated sections that are groovy but with slightly varying parameters like amplitude to maintain interest. I also felt the virtual instruments used were too far from traditional instruments and didn\u0026#39;t give the sound I had wanted (something closer to strings).

In these clips rhythm is highly varied through a long Basket Gen string, amplitude is controlled by beta and exponential distributions, and BPM is varied sinusoidally throughout the samples. In both cases the length and start positions of the clips are varied to produce a non-rhythmic sound cloud. In the first A, the rhythms are played by 505 drum sounds while in the last A the sounds come from wobbly bass sounds generated from a sawtooth wave sound with some LFO manipulations (I had it laying around in Ableton so I decided to use it). The B section is in time, beginning with percussion hits and using a consistent bass drum and a snare drum borrowed from a Tony Williams solo. A cymbal pattern in 12/8 is introduced but I feel like it could have been more prominently displayed. Everything is drenched in reverb. I used a Tascam control surface to mix sounds so the sections smoothly transition together. While the piece is too long, I enjoy how the sections overlap and the almost vintage feel that the old drum machine sounds deliver. I like producing sets of sounds that can be \u0026#34;performed,\u0026#34; even if means there is no definitive version of the piece."

That piece was a series of cat purrs and I used the same source material for this piece (purrs, meows, and field sound). Most of the material sampled I found online in free sound databases (notably freesound.org) but I also spent a significant amount of time capturing sounds from my own cat, Eegloo. None of those sounds are used except for the \u0026#34;bird\u0026#34; sound that contains some birds outside my window that start talking at about 4:00 a.m."

Each one moves at a different speed to create some interesting aspects when the values are at a maximum together, for example. A base of purrs is used to give some bottom to the sound where the granular synthesis is the top. The purrs have a low-pass filter on them to isolate them. The piece sounds the best on headphones or on a floor populated with transducers. Two different purrs begin (one in each channel) and then a faster, more frantic purr provides a setting for the other sounds. The granulated sounds are allowed to mingle for the main section of the piece before being removed and only the bird sound and a purr is left. The bird sound is then slowed to almost its recorded speed and pitch before exiting and allowing the purrs to finish the piece. The PD file does contain some objects to allow me to \u0026#34;punch\u0026#34; in meow sounds via MIDI input but I decided not to use them."

More sculpting of the granular synthesis parameters could always strengthen their use, including developing more precise graphs in athenaCL to use in PD. I also think using a variable metro rate would be interesting too (using the reading of one graph to control the reading speed of another graph). Maybe another granular synthesizer would add more texture and could be used in the middle of the piece to have something super dense that is just a knot of sound and then it untangles back to discernible noises."

While the GEM object \u0026#34;pix_data\u0026#34; can also produce RGB values, I only needed the greyscale values. This gave me 9 streams of values ranging between 0-1 where 1 = white and 0 = black to use in sound generation."

I recognized that frames that were lighter in contrast had higher tension in the narrative of the film so I decided to make them softer than the other frames. I used each vertical section of data sensors to control three polyphonic granular synthesizers to generate the low base of the sound. They are fed various sound files: two explosions and one sample of bass. Then each data sensor controlled an oscillator and a noise generator. I tried to manipulate the data more by generating more information: how the current data value compares to a local average, how it compares to a local minimum and maximum, how it compares to values of closely adjacent frames. These other data streams controlled values such as the pitch of the oscillator (within a specified band), band pass values for the pink noise generator, volume of the noise, and LFO on the oscillator."

Admittedly, most of the time was spent on making sound on a micro-scale— the amount of LFO, the frequency range, the band pass values—and not as much on overall contours (except for basic considerations such as overall contrast values controlling the master volume). There could have been more effort but into trigger-based sounds instead of continuous sounds whose control values were constantly being changed. This would introduce both more space and interest into the sound. Also using more pre-composed segments that could be triggered would be useful. There may have also been too many \u0026#34;sound units\u0026#34; going on—when listening to one voice, the oscillations and sound over time are sort of interesting but this type of concentration is lost when hearing all 9 voices together with the granular synthesizers."

I hope to keep working with this patch in order to produce something that sounds much better and improve my skills in PD."
